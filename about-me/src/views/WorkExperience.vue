        <h3>LG SOFT INDIA</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed WebMapEditor (Web) and MapEditorPlus (PC) for LG Cloud delivery robots, enhancing navigation in buildings.</li>
          <li>Created a custom Image Editing Tool, similar to GIMP, focused on intricate Image Manipulation.</li>
          <li>Optimized server modules, transitioning from serialized to parallel pipe uploads to AWS S3, resulting in a ~150% speed increase in reading/writing map image data.</li>
          <li>Improved canvas editing code, reducing heap memory footprint from ~2GB to a more efficient 650MB.</li>
          <li>Engineered critical features like map validation, supporting ~2000 interlinked nodes and points of interest (POIs).</li>
          <li>Enhanced canvas painting functionality for exponential speed and introduced image merging for multiple layers of graphics pixels based on robot conditions.</li>
          <li>Developed a versatile library for zip/unzip of tar files, retaining user permissions on the server over the network.</li>
          <li>Currently working on a generic graphics manipulation library for 3D capabilities in "MapEditor" using "WebGL" and "WebGPU" APIs.</li>
          <li>Led the migration of front-end code from Vue 2 to Vue 3, successfully refactoring ~5,000 lines of code in the MapEditor PC app.</li>
          <li>Led a team of interns working on File Transfer Tools for Robot  PC and PC  AWS S3 communication.</li>
          <li>Successfully migrated the desktop app to the web, deploying it on AWS Elastic Container Service using Docker.</li>
